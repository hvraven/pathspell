pathspell is a program to help players and games masters of the Pathfinder RPG.
It has an XML file containing the spells of the game (currently only a few for testing purposes, feel free to add more and commit them).

Currently pathspell is a very early stage, meanig it's running, but has propably many bugs and many features are missing. For Example the interface is just for testing of the functions and not final yet.
The XML syntax isn't final yet, too. Some attributes, like target aren't implemented yet and stored as annotation.

planned features:
 * search function...
 * a real interface
 * filter options (per class and spell level)
 * optional ncurses interface for less dependencies

To compile pathspell you will need the following libraries with their dependencies:
gtkmm (version >= 3.0)
tinyxml
